### About me

Experienced Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry. I started of in the old days with my first programming language being Visual Basic. Continued doing C / C++ and then turned into Web Development, mostly php in the beginning. I have a passion for UI / UX and I am interested in gaining more knowledge in the field. I believe most development processes should start from a user interface / user experience perspective, providing a successful user experience is key.

2019 I moved into an engineering manager role, leading teams and mentoring engineers to improve their skills which I find satisfying.

I believe in transparency, keeping everyone well-informed and support every person in the team, which builds trust. Everybody is unique/different, so it´s a matter of understanding what drives and motivates each person, find out their strengths as well as areas they can improve.

I like to lead by example, not afraid to do necessary hands-on work.
